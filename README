INTRODUCTION

This is a jQuery port of Cory Mawhorter's Facelift javascript frontend.
It requires no changs to the PHP backend.

It lacks many features from the original script but gets the job done 
for basic image replacement. It benefits from jQuery's features such as 
the selectors engine, method chaining and other powerful features. 
Although it doesn't have all the features of the original script, its 
size is about 25% of the original script.

This is intended for basic image replacement usage. It was created to
take advantage of jquery's features to reduce size, and also to trim
down on features that I deemed useless for my purposes. I'll try to 
keep it up to date with the current stable Facelift version, but dont
hold your breath.

THIS PLUGIN IS NOT OFFICIALY SUPPORTED BY FACELIFT'S AUTHOR. Don't go
crazy on the forums if you are using this and something is not working.

LICENSE

This plugin is licensed under the MIT license.

BASIC USAGE

Just select a few elements and call the facelift() function, like this:

$(document).ready(function() {
	$('h3, span.whatever').facelift({
		path: '/flir/',
		font: 'custom_font'});
	});
});

The function accepts an object that should contain a 'path' property,
which is the path to the 'generate.php' file. Also, there is support
for a 'font' property, created mainly as a workaround for an Opera 
issue that makes it impossible to retrieve the intended font from CSS.

FUTURE PLANS (in order of priority)

 * Improve the plugin architecture. Passing the path at each function
call is not what I would call optimal.
 * Reduce the code size even more
 * Implementing hover events
 * Allow more customization when calling the facelift() function. 
Currently I rely almost entirely on CSS rules for layout.
 * Try to figure out a workaround for Opera (see BASIC USAGE)
